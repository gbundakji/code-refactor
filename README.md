# Gassan's Horiseon Code Refactor Challenge 1

## Description

In this assignment, we are tasked with refactoring the  HTML and CSS code in order for the webpage to follow accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines. I completed this project in order to meet the required criteria which was to meet accessibility standards, provide source code that includes semantic HTML elements, structure the HTML so that the elements follow a logical structure, add accessible alt attributes to the icon and image elements, order the heading attributes in sequential order, and provide a cocise and descritpive title in the title element. In doing this, I learned about the proper use and orginzation of semantic HTML elemnts and how they should be structured in a clean and logical fashion for easy readability of the code. There were many other things I learned about the use of different HTML tags and CSS styling elements. 

## Table of Contents

## Installation

To run this project, copy the index.html code and style.css code, which can be found in the "Develop" folder, into a coding platform such as Virtual Studio Code. If you dont already have it, download the Live Server extension. Then save the file to your computer, and click "Go Live". A new window should open with the live webpage.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
