## Description

In this assignment, we are tasked with refactoring the  HTML and CSS code in order for the webpage to follow accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines. I completed this project in order to meet the required criteria which was to meet accessibility standards, provide source code that includes semantic HTML elements, structure the HTML so that the elements follow a logical structure, add accessible alt attributes to the icon and image elements, order the heading attributes in sequential order, and provide a cocise and descritpive title in the title element. In doing this, I learned about the proper use and orginzation of semantic HTML elemnts and how they should be structured in a clean and logical fashion for easy readability of the code. There were many other things I learned about the use of different HTML tags and CSS styling elements. 

## Installation

Open the page at this github link: To run this project, copy the index.html code and style.css code, which can be found in the "Develop" folder, into a coding platform such as Virtual Studio Code. If you dont already have it, download the Live Server extension. Then save the file to your computer, and click "Go Live". A new window should open with the live webpage.

## Usage
go to this site and add screen shot
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
